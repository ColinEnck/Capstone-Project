# Capstone-Project

My capstone project is to create a Rogue-like video game from scratch, no
game engine used. I created an asteroids game in Lua and the LOVE2D framework
as an exercise in gamedev on that framework, however I am still deciding which
framework will be the best for my project. The current idea is that I will
soon start development on an ASCII terminal game, using either Python, Rust,
or C.
