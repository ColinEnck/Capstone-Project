# Capstone-Project
Not sure what this project will be yet, but this is where I will hold the code for it.\
Project ideas currently:\
1. A RPi Pico W that looks like a USB device that can log keystrokes from the computer it is plugged into, as well as other hacking purposes as a POC for how someone can hack your computer with a USB stick.\
2. A Morse Code translation device that will take in an audio input and record the corresponding characters on serial port on an attached computer.
